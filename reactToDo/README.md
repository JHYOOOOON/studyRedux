# studyRedux

What I studied about redux from Nomad Coders

## - createStore(reducer)

    We can modify store using reducer function only.

## - dispatch()

    We can communicate with reducer about 'action'.

## - subscribe()

    We can catch a change of state.

## - change the state

    We can change the state to send an action only.

## - should never mutate the state

    You don't modify the state. You return a new one.
